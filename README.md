<p>Here is the netlify link for my site hosted on Netlify:<p>
<p>https://priceless-yonath-3c7b48.netlify.app<p>
<p>This project (HW2) will focus on adding CSS code to the previous HTML version of a website (HW1) for a hypothetical startup called Play By Numbers and then hosting it on Netlify.<p>
<p>This company does not exist yet, but the venture will involve hosting historical data that users research using our site. Users will be able to find data on their favorite sports, teams, and players.<p>
<p>Whether it is placing a bet or winning your fantasy league, users will make Play By Numbers their first stop for a data-driven approach to sports.<p>
