  <title>KIEI-451: Week 2 Homework</title>

  <div class="container mx-auto py-8">
    <h1 class="text-lg uppercase text-gray-500 font-bold">KIEI-451: Introduction to Software Development</h1>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold my-4">Week 2 Homework Instructions</h2>
    <div class="mt-4 space-y-4">
      <p>This week, you will expand the business website that you created in the first homework, adding styling using the Tailwind CSS framework. In addition, you'll add a form to add user interactivity to your website. The form can be for any purpose that makes sense in the context of what you're building – contact form, order form, survey, etc. Finally, you'll host your site on the Internet using Netlify and accept public form submissions.</p>
      <p>Begin by creating a new repository in your GitHub account. Name this repository <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">hw2</span> and clone the repository to your computer. Don't try to rename your project from last week or otherwise copy-and-paste/duplicate the folder from last week in order to create your <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">hw2</span> repository – start from scratch, copying individual HTML files and images if you need to.</p>
      <h3 class="font-bold text-xl">Style Guidelines</h3>
      <p>On your 3+ existing web pages, you should implement the Tailwind framework by adding class names to elements that will affect your website's:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
        <li>Colors</li>
        <li>Typography</li>
        <li>Borders</li>
        <li>Sizing</li>
        <li>Box Model</li>
        <li>Layout (Flexbox)</li>
        <li>Responsive Design</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This is <strong>not</strong> a design class; your work will not be judged on how well your pages are actually designed. Just do your best to make it look like a real website you'd find in the wild, aside from the requirements as described in the rubric.</p>
      <h3 class="font-bold text-xl">Rubric (10 points total)</h3>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>3 points: adding the Tailwind CSS framework to all of your website's pages, and add Tailwind CSS classes to the existing elements. At least one class should be added to the page to affect an element's color, typography, borders, sizing, and box model.</li>
        <li>3 points: At least one flexbox (left-to-right) layout element should be present. This element should appear stacked (i.e. not left-to-right but rather top-to-bottom) on a small device screen, like a phone in vertical orientation.</li>
        <li>2 points: Add a form to at least one of your web pages – it can be intended to capture any type of information, and be able to be successfully submitted to Netlify on your live site.</li>
        <li>2 points: Your site should be launched live on the Internet using Netlify. <strong>Important!</strong> In the <code>README.md</code> located in your project's root, include the full Internet URL (e.g. <code>https://yourapp.netlify.app/</code>) of your website. This is the only way we will know the publicly available location and for you to receive full credit for this requirement.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="my-4">Finally, and once again, be sure to&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>submit your Github repository's URL via
            Canvas</strong></span><strong> - this is the ONLY way we will know what your Github username is and where your finished code lives!</p>
